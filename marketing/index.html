It was the first operating system that allowed programs to be both developed and run in a single environment, relieving programmers from the tedious work of mediums such as punch cards. It came bundled with C, the first programming language that was hardware agnostic. Programs no longer had to be rewritten to work on another computer.</h3></td>

Their luck changed however in 1991, when a young Finnish programmer named Linus Torvalds was able to create an open source kernel called Linux that could use all of <i>GNU</i>'s tools. Many project members demand that Linux always be referred to as GNU/Linux to give credit to the large codebase that every Linux installation uses.</h3></td>
